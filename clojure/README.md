- Finished 2015 Day 1 Part 2.
- Reimplemented 2015 Day 1 Part 1 using learnings from Day 2 Part 2.
  - Follow-up: figure out why `apply-seq` includes a last element of `nil`.

# 2022-05-11

- Looked into running [Clojure on Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/clojure).
- Based on descriptions from [this page](https://practical.li/clojure-staging/alternative-tools/clojure-tools/compare-with-leiningen.html), opted to go with the Docker image with Clojure CLI tools bundled.
- The [Quick Reference](https://clojuredocs.org/quickref) in the Clojure documentation seems handy.
- Files for Clojure code conventionally use the `.clj` extension and are run by calling `clj -M [path]`.
- Finished 2015 Day 1 Part 1.
