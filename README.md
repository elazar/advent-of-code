This repo is my personal attempt to stay committed to doing programming puzzles
from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) long enough to learn new
languages reasonably well. Wish me luck!

# Current Goal

- Complete every AoC puzzle from 2015 to present in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

# Past Progress

- I completed the first 9 days of 2017 that same year in [Golang](https://go.dev/) but stopped there.

# Organization

- This repository contains a directory per language.
- Each language directory contains a directory for each year of Advent of Code for which I've completed puzzles.
- Each year directory contains a directory for the day associated with the Advent of Code puzzles.
- Each day directory contains any relevant input and my solutions to the puzzles for that day.
